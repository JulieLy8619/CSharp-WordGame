# Lab03-WordGame

We created a version of the game Hangman where a random word will be selected from a list in a file. Then a user will guess one letter at a time to figure out the word
We also made it possible the User could be the admin and add or remove words from the word bank.

## Solution

As a user, you are presented with a menu to play the game or administrate the word bank. 
If you choose to play then the program will pick a random word from the word bank and display it as blank spaces. One would then make guesses at letters, and as one finds the letters it will fill in the blanks.
If you choose to be admin, one could view the word bank, add to the word bank, or to remove a word from the word bank.

There is a known bug in regards to the delete word from word bank.
